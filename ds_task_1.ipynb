For more efficient implementation of indent one of the preceding paragraph, notwithstanding the provisions of the Law of Property Code, the following shall be sufficient for the determination of agricultural land user and land use practices: - the consent of co-owners whose undivided interest represents more than half of the surface area of the land, if agricultural land is co-owned, - the consent of more than half of the owners if agricultural land is co-owned. If the agricultural inspection authority establishes that an owner, lesser or other user of agricultural land fails to act in accordance with indent one of paragraph one of this Article, it shall impose the implementation of appropriate measures by a decision. An owner, lesser or other user of agricultural land must carry out such measures within the time limits set by the decision, which, however, may not exceed a period of one year. If the agricultural inspection authority establishes that an owner, lesser or other user of agricultural land fails to act in accordance with indent two of paragraph one of this Article, it shall impose the implementation of appropriate measures by a decision. An owner, lesser or other user of agricultural land must carry out such measures no later than within a year of being served the decision; otherwise, the necessary measures shall be carried out at the expense of the owner, lesser or other user of agricultural land in an executive procedure. If the implementation of the measures referred to in indent two of paragraph one of this Article cannot be imposed upon the owner of agricultural land because his or her residence is unknown and he or she has no legal representative, such land shall be transferred to the Fund for temporary management. An agricultural inspector shall notify an administrative unit of the owner of agricultural land with an unknown residence and without a legal representative and carry out the procedure for the transfer of such land to the Fund for temporary management. An administrative unit shall submit a proposal to a social work centre that a trustee be appointed for this specific case, who shall participate in the procedure for the transfer of such land to the Fund for temporary management. The right to the temporary management of agricultural land shall ex officio be entered in the land register on the basis of the final decision of an administrative unit. An owner may submit an application to an administrative unit for the cessation of temporary management. Temporary management shall cease upon the decision on the cessation of temporary management becoming final. If such agricultural land has been leased out and the owner and lesser do not agree otherwise, the lease shall cease three years after the decision on the cessation of temporary management becomes final, while the lesser shall have the right to cultivate the land until the crops have been harvested, but no later than until the end of the calendar year. In cases referred to in the preceding paragraph, the owner of agricultural land shall be obliged to refund to the Fund or possible lesser all expenses and investments related to the land; if the land was leased out, the owner shall be entitled to half of the rent over the lease period during temporary management. The Government shall determine detailed criteria for assessing whether an owner, lesser or other user of agricultural land has acted with due diligence. Persons who are not owners, losses or other users of agricultural land shall use agricultural land on their own responsibility. '"
