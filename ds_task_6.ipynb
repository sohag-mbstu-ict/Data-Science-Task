The agricultural land is protected by the Federal Constitution. The agricultural land should be used for agriculture. If this is not possible, it must first be planned in areas of other agricultural land and only afterwards in areas of permanently protected agricultural land; in these areas, the planning shall first take place regarding agricultural land with a lower land rating. In the spatial planning procedure of local communities, areas of other agricultural land may also be converted before Page 63 areas of permanently protected agricultural land. The Federal Government has to ensure that the area of agricultural land does not decrease. In addition to the Federal Constitution, there are numerous laws and regulations that aim at protecting agricultural land. The most important are the Federal Land Conservation Act (Bundeslandwirtschaftsgesetz) and the Federal Soil Conservation Act (Bodenschutzgesetz). They are complemented by numerous other laws and regulations, e.g., the Federal Building Code (Baugesetzbuch) and the Federal Water Act (Wasserverwaltungsgesetz). The Federal Land Conservation Act contains provisions on the conservation of agricultural land as well as soil conservation measures. It aims at preventing soil erosion and soil degradation and at maintaining or improving soil fertility. In addition, it strives to ensure that agricultural production remains possible in the long term. The Federal Soil Conservation Act contains provisions on soil conservation and aims at preventing soil erosion and soil degradation as well as at maintaining or improving soil fertility.

The Act implements the provisions of Directive No. 2001/42/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the assessment of the effects of certain plans and programmes on the environment (the EIA Directive). The Act regulates planning at three levels: • national level – national spatial plan; • regional level – regional spatial plan; • local level – municipal spatial plan. The Act defines a planning area as a territory which has been designated for planning purposes. The territory of the Czech Republic is divided into planning areas. The national spatial plan is drawn up for all planning areas, whereas regional and municipal spatial plans are drawn up for individual planning areas. The Act defines a spatial plan as a comprehensive document which sets out a comprehensive concept for development and use of land, water bodies, air space and subsoil within a planning area. A spatial plan is drawn up for a definite period of time which is not shorter than 10 years or longer than 20 years. A spatial plan may be amended or revoked only by a new spatial plan or by another legal regulation. A spatial plan may not be amended or revoked by an administrative decision. A national spatial plan shall be drawn up in such a way that it takes into account: • protection of natural values; • protection of agricultural land; • protection of water resources; • protection of air quality; • protection against floods; and also: • transport infrastructure; • public utility infrastructure; • economic development; • tourism and recreation;\n",
